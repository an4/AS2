Q.1 As a security consultant, you have been working on a prototype of the
    attack target; before the product is deployed, the vendor is willing to
    make any alteration necessary (in software or hardware) to prevent the
    attack.  Explain the options available, and which one you would
    recommend.
Q.2 Your implementation of this attack will target some operation during
    execution of AES.  Identify which operation you target, and explain
    why.  Outline other operation(s) you could have targeted, and why they
    might be a better or worse choice.
Q.4 DPA attacks rely on a leakage model; for an Intel 8051, one might
    consider Hamming weight or Hamming distance models for example. Explain
    and justify the choice of model you used (e.g., explain why/how the
    attack target might leak information in this way).
Q.3 Suppose the attack target executes AES in CBC mode rather than ECB. How
    would you alter your attack strategy to cope with this change?
