Q.1 The vendor of the attack target is concerned that news of this attack
    could scare off potential customers; they will make any alteration
    necessary (in software or hardware) to prevent the attack.  Explain the
    options they have, and which one you would recommend.

Answer:
    This attack cannot be carried out against systems that are using Chinese
    Remainder Theorem for Modular Exponentiation. I would suggest changing the
    Square and Multiply algorithm and using CRT instead.

Q.2 Let n denote the number of simulated clock cycles required to execute a
    Montgomery multiplication on the attack target.  Estimate the value of
    n (as accurately as you can) and explain how you did so.

Answer:
    find private key
    hamming weight
    send 0 to attack target
    get time
    time / (size key in bits + hamming weight )

Q.7 Numerous factors might produce noise within measurements of execution
    time: based on the given attack target and context, outline at least
    two examples.

Answer:


Q.4 Given that you selected one particular statistical test within your
    implementation of this attack, explain what other options you had. What
    advantages and disadvantages does the option selected have?

Answer:
